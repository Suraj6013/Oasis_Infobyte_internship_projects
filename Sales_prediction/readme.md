Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So here's the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
